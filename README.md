### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brandon Alvarez
#### **Software** Engineer <-- *Environmental Engineer*  
I live in New York City (proudly born & raised here.)
I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering with an Environmental Engineering Concentration. 

I have several years of experience as an engineer and in technical roles. I found my passion for software engineering while learning to apply programming in solving civil/environmental engineering problems.
I quickly found I loved the programming part of solving modern engineering problems more than any other aspect!

I am also a veteran drone operator and paratrooper, so I am no stranger to facing complex challenges, both physical and technical!

Now I am combining my diverse skillsets and experience, bringing together ambition, technical strengths, and collaborative attitude to innovate scalable and modern solutions to unique and sometimes ambiguous problems, and I couldn't be happier!

Skills: JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, React, SQL

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a suspenseful 2D side-scrolling game! (Check it out here! https://the-boogeyman.netlify.app/) This game is still in progress so stay tuned for continuously integrated updates!
