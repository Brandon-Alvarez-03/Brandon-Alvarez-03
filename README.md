- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon Alvarez (@Brandon-Alvarez-03), I live in New York City (proudly born & raised here.)
      I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering with an Environmental Engineering Concentration. I am looking to augment my skills to combine my education and experience with           programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in hydraulic modeling, data science, GIS, and automating engineering tasks and calculations. Special interests include surface water-quality modeling        and the fate and transport of contaminants as well as computational fluid dynamics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, numpy, GIS, Spanish and Dutch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on light projects that will open the door for me to practice the fundamentals of my learning interests.
